## Project Description
The project applies machine learning models like Random Forest to predict fraudulent transactions. Various metrics like F1 Score and ROC-AUC Curve are used to evaluate the performance of these models. The data is explored and visualized to uncover patterns and trends that aid in improving the accuracy of the predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

### Description
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. Due to privacy concerns, the original features of the dataset have been transformed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). As a result, the columns do not have directly interpretable physical significance. However, this transformation ensures that the dataset remains realistic while protecting the privacy of the individuals involved.
